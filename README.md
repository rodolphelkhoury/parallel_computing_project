# Parallel Heat Simulation

> Note: This README is a placeholder and will be updated.

## Prerequisites

- C++ compiler with C++17 support
- CMake ≥ 3.16

## Build Instructions

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project root:
```bash
   cd parallel_computing_project
```

2. Create and enter the build directory:
```bash
   mkdir -p build
   cd build
```

3. Configure the project using CMake:
```bash
   cmake ..
```

4. Build the project:
```bash
